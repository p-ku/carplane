# Motion Blur

This motion blur is based on "[A Fast and Stable Feature-Aware Motion Blur Filter](https://casual-effects.com/research/Guertin2014MotionBlur/index.html)" by Guertin, McGuire, and Nowrouzezahrai. I wanted good motion blur in Godot, but there didn't seem to be much out in the community beyond simple implementations. Simple can work, but I wasn't happy with the artifacts I was seeing.
